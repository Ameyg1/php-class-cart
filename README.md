# php-class-cart

There are three classes:

* Product: Each Product has an id, name and price.

* Cartitem: Each CartItem has the Product and the quantity which the buyer will buy of th product.

* Cart: Each Cart is a Array of Cartitems.

The main focus was OOPs concepts so all the three classes have methods through which we access the and create a CART.

## index.php
This is the file with the output. However, Some requirements as per assessment were not met. I tried my level best and found myself stuck in few places for long. However I would love to hear your input and learn from them. The main issue was the session and the cart resetting everything. However you can add an item and change its quantity from the page. The Cart gets reset everytime and I went on for hours but could not do more due to time limit.

## oops.php
This showcases what I have achived in OOPS concepts. Each class has a method function which helps us access the variables without the variables being seen.
